First let's think what does bitwise AND do to two numbers, for example ( 0b means base 2)

4 & 7 = 0b100 & 0b111 = 0b100
5 & 7 = 0b101 & 0b111 = 0b101
5 & 6 = 0b101 & 0b110 = 0b100

The operator & is keeping those bits which is set in both number.

For several numbers, the operator & is keeping those bits which is 1 in every number.

In other word, a bit is 0 in any number will result in 0 in the answer's corresponding bit.

Now consider a range

[m = 0bxyz0acd, n=0bxyz1rst]
here xyzpacdrst all are digits in base 2.

We can find two numbers that are special in the range [m, n]

(1) m' = 0bxyz0111
(2) n' = 0bxyz1000

The bitwise AND of all the numbers in range [m, n] is just the bitwise AND of the two special number

rangeBitwiseAnd(m, n) = m' & n' = 0bxyz0000

This tells us, the bitwise and of the range is keeping the common bits of m and n from left to right until the first bit that they are different, padding zeros for the rest.
